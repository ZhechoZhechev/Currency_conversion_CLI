## About The Project
It is a CLI currency convertor that accepts past date and uses the fastFORES API.

<ul>
  <li>The application accepts a command line argument for the date in format '2024-12-31'</li>
  <li>The application is able to process multiple conversions</li>
  <li>The application continuously validates all inputs until a correct one is submitted. Ðœonetary values are constrained to two decimal places. Currencies are in ISO 4217 three letter currency code format</li>
  <li>The application is case-insensitive</li>
  <li>The application is caching the exchange rates for each requested base currency. Subsequent conversions with this base currency are using the cached data, instead of calling the API</li>
  <li>Each successful conversion is saved in a json file</li>
  <li>The application is terminated by typing 'END' on any input</li>
  <li>The application is loading the api_key for Fast Forex from a config.json file which must be ignored by the version control</li>
</ul>
